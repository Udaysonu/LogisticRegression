Develop a machine learning algorithm, logistic regression in python without using Octave or Matlab. Logistic Regression is a type of regression that estimates the probability of an event occurred. For example, an email is spam or not, sentiment is positive or negative etc.</p>

<p><b>Problem Definition</b><br>
The main challenge was to implement logistic regression in an uncommon language such as python instead of Octave or Matlab. Since this is an algorithm that users can use hence I a dataset of student scores provided in the lab example was used. The dataset was of student scores for estimation of admission probability between 45 and 85.</p>

<p><b>Big Data Problem &amp; Data Collection</b><br>
This algorithm will be used to solve big data problem since it analyzes the data and gives result in terms of probabilities. Data is big data since a there can be a lot of students in every school for which we can determine the admission probabilities. The data was taken from the lab of the distributed programming course of admission probabilities as an example to test logistic regression algorithm.</p>

<p><b>Solving Strategy</b><br>
Logistic Regression is usually implemented in Octave or Matlab. In order to implement in python, similar packages were required. In one of the labs, we implemented logistic regression in Octave hence using that as an example, step by step analysis of algorithm was done and implemented in python. For statistical analysis and plotting -</p>

<p><b>Software Tools for developing algorithm</b><br>
 Programming language Python for algorithm<br>
 Debugging Python command line<br>
 Statistical analysis Scipy stack which consisted of numpy (matrix multiplication and linear statistical functions), optimize method of scipy and math module of python<br>
 Graph plots Scipy stack consisted of Matplotlib for plotting graphs<br>
 Operating System Ubuntu 13.04 for development<br><br>
The following are the key steps in logistic regression. Using the same, I made a function in python for developing the working solution. Every logistic regression function below has a separate implementation in python.<br></p>

<p><b>Coding Instructions</b><br>
There is only 1 script of logistic regression and a dataset of university students and scores provided.<br><b>Steps:</b><br>
1. You can download the zip file and make sure you have <code>scipy, matplotlib, numpy, pylab and python</code> installed.<br>
2. You can install them all with this:<br><code>sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook pyt</code>
<code>hon-pandas python-sympy python-nose</code><br>
3. Once downloaded, directly run python log.py which would help you to get the probabilities.<br>
4. A graph will open as an output and the result.<br><br>
I am still advancing the algorithm to make it a better solution.</p>
